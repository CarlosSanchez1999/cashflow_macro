ðŸ“Š Monthly Partner Report Generator
Description
The Monthly Partner Report Generator is an Excel macro that automates the creation of a "SOCIOS" sheet based on the existing "FLUJO" sheet. The macro allows you to select a specific month and generate a weekly breakdown of financial data while maintaining the original format of the "FLUJO" sheet. The main motivation for this project is to facilitate quick and accurate financial data analysis, reducing manual errors and saving time in report generation.

The primary technology used is VBA (Visual Basic for Applications), as it allows cell manipulation and sheet handling within Excel. A key challenge in this project was coding the dynamic generation of weeks. This was particularly difficult because the number of weeks varies by month, requiring flexible column range adjustments.
